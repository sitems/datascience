In fact, a CP problem may not even have an objective function — the goal may simply be to narrow down a vary large set of possible solutions to a more manageable subset by adding constraints to the problem.\n",
    "-An example of a problem that is well-suited for CP is employee scheduling. The problem arises when companies that operate continuously — such as factories — need to create weekly schedules for their employees. Here's a very simple example: a company runs three 8-hour shifts per day and assigns three of its four employees to different shifts each day, while giving the fourth the day off. Even in such a small case, the number of possible schedules is huge: each day, there are 4! = 4 · 3 · 2 · 1  = 24 possible employee assignments, so the number of possible weekly schedules is 247, which is over 4.5 billion. Usually there will be other constraints that reduce the number of feasible solutions — for example, that each employee works at least a minimum number of days per week. The CP method keeps track of which solutions remain feasible when you add new constraints, which makes it a powerful tool for solving large, real-world scheduling problems.\n",
