    "CP is based on feasibility (finding a feasible solution) rather than optimization (finding an optimal solution) and focuses on the constraints and variables rather than the objective function. In fact, a CP problem may not even have an objective function — the goal may simply be to narrow down a vary large set of possible solutions to a more manageable subset by adding constraints to the problem.\n",
    "-An example of a problem that is well-suited for CP is employee scheduling. The problem arises when companies that operate continuously — such as factories — need to create weekly schedules for their employees. Here's a very simple example: a company runs three 8-hour shifts per day and assigns three of its four employees to different shifts each day, while giving the fourth the day off. Even in such a small case, the number of possible schedules is huge: each day, there are 4! = 4 · 3 · 2 · 1  = 24 possible employee assignments, so the number of possible weekly schedules is 247, which is over 4.5 billion. Usually there will be other constraints that reduce the number of feasible solutions — for example, that each employee works at least a minimum number of days per week. The CP method keeps track of which solutions remain feasible when you add new constraints, which makes it a powerful tool for solving large, real-world scheduling problems.\n",

In many problems, a greedy strategy does not usually produce an optimal solution, but nonetheless a greedy heuristic may yield locally optimal solutions that approximate a globally optimal solution in a reasonable amount of time.\n",
    "For example, a greedy strategy for the travelling salesman problem (which is of a high computational complexity) is the following heuristic: \"At each step of the journey, visit the nearest unvisited city.\" This heuristic does not intend to find a best solution, but it terminates in a reasonable number of steps; finding an optimal solution to such a complex problem typically requires unreasonably many steps.\n",
    "Greedy algorithms can be characterized as being 'short sighted', and also as 'non-recoverable'. They are ideal only for problems which have 'optimal substructure'. Despite this, for many simple problems, the best suited algorithms are greedy algorithms. It is important, however, to note that the greedy algorithm can be used as a selection algorithm to prioritize options within a search, or branch-and-bound algorithm.\n",
    "Greedy algorithms mostly (but not always) fail to find the globally optimal solution because they usually do not operate exhaustively on all the data. They can make commitments to certain choices too early which prevent them from finding the best overall solution later. For example, all known greedy coloring algorithms for the graph coloring problem and all other NP-complete problems do not consistently find optimum solutions. Nevertheless, they are useful because they are quick to think up and often give good approximations to the optimum.\n",

Of course, you might have to wait for a while until the algorithm finishes, and only then can you start driving. The path you will take will be the fastest one (assuming that nothing changed in the external environment).\n",

    "# subset sum problem\n",
    "In computer science, the subset sum problem is an important decision problem in complexity theory and cryptography. There are several equivalent formulations of the problem. One of them is: given a set (or multiset) of integers, is there a non-empty subset whose sum is zero? For example, given the set {\\displaystyle \\{-7,-3,-2,9000,5,8\\}}{\\displaystyle \\{-7,-3,-2,9000,5,8\\}}, the answer is yes because the subset {\\displaystyle \\{-3,-2,5\\}}{\\displaystyle \\{-3,-2,5\\}} sums to zero. The problem is NP-complete, meaning roughly that while it is easy to confirm whether a proposed solution is valid, it may inherently be prohibitively difficult to determine in the first place whether any solution exists.\n",

Although the partition problem is NP-complete, there is a pseudo-polynomial time dynamic programming solution, and there are heuristics that solve the problem in many instances, either optimally or approximately. For this reason, it has been called \"the easiest hard problem\".\n",
    "-Given S = {3,1,1,2,2,1}, a valid solution to the partition problem is the two sets S1 = {1,1,1,2} and S2 = {2,3}. Both sets sum to 5, and they partition S. Note that this solution is not unique. S1 = {3,1,1} and S2 = {2,2,1} is another solution.\n",
