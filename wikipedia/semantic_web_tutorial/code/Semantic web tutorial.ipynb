    "RDF is a concept\n",
    "\n",
    "RDF is a concept or a way of describing things. The concept of RDF is that you are describing / defining anything using sets of THREE terms. Ex: \"Ana has apples\", \"Apples are tasty\", these two strings are perfectly valid RDF descriptions (conceptually speaking). In doesn't matter where and how you store described data, in files, or papers, or drawings on the sand, or paintings on a wall. The main important thing is that the data is described as triples (using the RDF concept). The semantic web is built using this concept (RDF). [cize rdf je nieco ako specifikacia, ale existuju rozne typy suborov, ako tie triplety ukaldat, a turtle je jednym z formatov]\n",
    "\n",
    "RDF is a NAME of a vocabulary\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: A vocabulary is just a set of term definitions stored in files or somewhere else. These terms have the purpose to be generally reused for describing data. So, you have your data, you have a vocabulary, now you can start adding descriptions to your data using the terms from the vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "RDF is a standard vocabulary that provides a set of terms. You can see the vocabulary here\n",
    "\n",
    "The terms provided by the RDF vocabulary help you make some basic standard descriptions like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you have the following data: \"Ana\" and \"Person\". So, to describe in a standard semantic web manner that your \"Ana\" is a \"Person\", you have to store the following triple somewhere:\n",
    "\n",
    "PREFIX rdf:<https://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns>\n",
    "<http://yourdomain.com/Ana> rdf:type <http://yourdomain.com/Person>\n",
    "The \"rdf:type\" term is defined in the RDF vocabulary and whenever you are using it you are describing the fact that the data that is in front of it (the subject) is an instance of the data (class) that is placed after it (the object).\n",
    "\n",
    "In general the RDF vocabulary provides terms for creating basic descriptions of instances of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "RDFS is a NAME of another vocabulary\n",
    "\n",
    "RDFS is a standard vocabulary just like RDF. If in the RDF vocabulary you have terms that help you give a basic definition/description of instanceenter code heres, in the RDFS vocabulary you have terms that help you define/describe classes. For example you have the definition of the term rdfs:subClassOf. With this term you can describe the fact that a class is a subclass of another.\n",
    "\n",
    "PREFIX rdfs:<https://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>\n",
    "<http://yourdomain.com/Teacher> rdfs:subClassOf <http://yourdomain.com/Person>  \n",
    "So, RDF has terms for creating instances, RDFS has terms for creating classes. By using both you can start making more detailed descriptions of your data. If you want to make even more complex descriptions, than you can use OWL which is just another vocabulary that provides a set of terms able to do that. OWL terms are defined using RDF and RDFS terms.\n",

    "\"ontology\" is just a SYNONYM of the term \"vocabulary\"\n",
    "\n",

    "look like a URL, and there may actually be a web page at that address, but there might\n",
    "not be; its primary job is to provide a unique name for something, not to tell you about\n",

    "### rdf vs rdfs vs owl\n",
    "RDF, RDFS, and ontology are not interchangeable terms. RDF (Resource Description Framework), is a conceptual data model which can be rendered physically (serialized) using various formats such N3, Turtle, RDF/XML, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "RDFS (RDF Schema) is \"a general-purpose language for representing simple RDF vocabularies on the Web.\" [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "The elements of RDFS can be used to construct an ontology. Of course, if you want more expressive power for ontology and you need to encode some properties that cannot be done using RDFS elements, you always have the OWL option.\n",
    "\n",
    "RDF and RDFS is not interchangeable.\n",
    "\n",
    "RDF is based on making statements about resources (web in this case) in the form of subject, predicate and objects expressions (i.e. triples). The subject denotes the resource and the predicate expresses the relationship between the subject and the object. RDF in general is a method of conceptual data modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "RDFS provides a mechanism for describing groups of related resources (RDF), and the relation between them. Example of these properties are classes, sub-classes, range and domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in essence, RDFS is a semantic extension of RDF. A person can have an RDF instance of an Animal and Dog, RDFS can specify that Animal is a class and Dog is a sub-class of Animal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many RDFS components are included in the more expressive Web Ontology Language (OWL).\n",

    "### rdf vs rdfs\n",
    "\n",
    "The next layer is RDF - The Resource Description Framework. RDF defines some extra structure to triples. The most important thing RDF defines is a predicate called \"rdf:type\". This is used to say that things are of certain types. Everyone uses rdf:type which makes it very useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "RDFS (RDF Schema) defines some classes which represent the concept of subjects, objects, predicates etc. This means you can start making statements about classes of thing, and types of relationship. At the most simple level you can state things like http://familyontology.net/1.0#hasFather is a relationship between a person and a person. It also allows you to describe in human readable text the meaning of a relationship or a class. This is a schema. It tells you legal uses of various classes and relationships. It is also used to indicate that a class or property is a sub-type of a more general type. For example \"HumanParent\" is a subclass of \"Person\". \"Loves\" is a sub-class of \"Knows\".\n",
    "\n",
    "RDF allows you to link resources (concepts) together so you could say  that (Karthik  is a person). Think about it as directed graph. However  you can't classify objects so you can't say for example that person is a  subclass of human-beings.. etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "RDFS gives you more  expressive  vocabulary. It allows you to classify resources by using the class and  subclass (rdfs:class, rdfs:subclass) notions. It also allows you to set  restriction on the properties(relationships) in your domain knowledge  using rdfs:Domain and rdfs:range.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### owl\n",
    "OWL adds semantics to the schema. It allows you to specify far more about the properties and classes. It is also expressed in triples. For example, it can indicate that \"If A isMarriedTo B\" then this implies \"B isMarriedTo A\". Or that if \"C isAncestorOf D\" and \"D isAncestorOf E\" then \"C isAncestorOf B\". Another useful thing owl adds is the ability to say two things are the same, this is very helpful for joining up data expressed in different schemas. You can say that relationship \"sired\" in one schema is owl:sameAs \"fathered\" in some other schema. You can also use it to say two things are the same, such as the \"Elvis Presley\" on wikipedia is the same one on the BBC. This is very exciting as it means you can start joining up data from multiple sites (this is \"Linked Data\").\n",
